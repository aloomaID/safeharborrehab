            <h3>Jurupa Valley, CA Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Jurupa Valley (Serrano: Hurumpa) is a city in the northwest corner of Riverside County, California, United States. It was the location of one of the earliest non-native settlements in the county, Rancho Jurupa. The Rancho was initially an outpost of the Mission San Gabriel Arcángel, then a Mexican land grant in 1838. The name is derived from a Native American village that existed in the area prior to the arrival of Europeans.</p>
