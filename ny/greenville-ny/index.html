            <p>Unique among Orange County towns, Greenville has neither cities nor villages, and most of the communities are small clusters of houses. (Residents of the town get their mail through the Port Jervis or Middletown post office.) Greenville is near Exit 4 off Interstate 84, which features the town's firehouse and a few other businesses.</p>
