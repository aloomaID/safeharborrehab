            <h3>Westwego, LA Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>One story states that Westwego was so named because it was a major crossing point on the Mississippi River during the great westward movement of the late 19th century. When travelers were asked their destination, they would often reply 'west we go'. Another more specific tale, recounted in John Churchill Chase's Frenchmen, Desire, Good Children is that the name was the specific outcome of an 1871 meeting of a railroad board of directors in New York, where planning was undertaken to use the site as an eastern terminus ('...west we go from there'). There has been further speculation that this use of 'Westwego' as a place name may have been influenced by the board members' familiarity with the name of Oswego, New York.</p>
