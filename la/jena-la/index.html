            <p>Chuck Wlodarczyk, author of Riverview Gone But Not Forgotten, once performed shows about the park and reported people often approached him afterwards to report hearsay of someone raped in the park restrooms by a black man, however no actual record of these crimes exist. A Chicago Tribune article from late 1967 also blames violence for the park's closure, however Wolcott says there is little evidence of increased violence at the park.</p>
