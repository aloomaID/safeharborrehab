                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Based on per capita income, one of the more reliable measures of affluence, Hobart ranks 31st of 522 areas in the state of Washington to be ranked. The Hobart area was first settled by loggers in 1879, and originally known as 'Vine Maple Valley'. The name was changed when deemed too long by the Post Office.
