            <h3>South Greensburg, PA Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>In 1780, Michael Rugh acquired title to 229.25 acres (0.9277 km2), which he operated as a farm. The land was passed on to his son, Jacob Rugh, and later to Jacob's son, Peter Rugh. The Rugh family house is still extant at 1213 Broad Street. The current building dates from the Civil War, but was built on the foundation of a much older structure. The area was known as Rughtown, although it was not yet a town in any meaningful sense.</p>
