            <h3>Saint Johns University, MN Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>By the early 1950s the monastic community had reached to a near 450 monks, and had outgrown the original abbey church and so plans were made to construct a new, larger worship space which could accommodate a larger congregation. The liturgical movement which would culminate in the Second Vatican Council was in full swing at Saint John's and so the new church was also to be designed with some of the anticipated liturgical changes in mind. (Following the Council, almost no changes needed to be made to incorporate the new liturgical rules.) The community contacted twelve architects and asked them to submit plans for a church which would 'be truly an architectural monument to the service of God.' In 1954 the community selected Marcel Breuer to design not only the new church but an addition to the monastic enclosure.</p>
