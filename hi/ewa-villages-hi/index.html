                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>This area was previously known as ʻEwa (in Hawaiian, ʻewa means 'crooked'). In the late 19th century to early 20th century, ʻEwa was one of the large population centers on the island of Oʻahu, with industry focused around sugar cane production. The ʻEwa Mill was a major employer that set up residential villages within ʻEwa (from which the modern name arose). Sugar cane is no longer grown on the ʻEwa Plain and ʻEwa is now one of Oʻahu's suburban growth centers—an area of substantial sprawl spreading unbroken to ʻEwa Gentry and ʻEwa Beach on the south, Kalaeloa on the southwest, and Kapolei on the west. This area is now referred to as Oʻahu's Second City, with a city center (downtown) located in Kapolei.</p>
