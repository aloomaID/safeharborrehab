            <h3>Exmore, VA Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Exmore is the largest town in Northampton County on the Eastern Shore of the U.S. state of Virginia. The population was 1,460 at the 2010 census. A popular story is that Exmore received its name because it is the tenth railroad station south of the Delaware state line, so there were 'X more' stations to go. The same website also states another theory behind the town's name—that it was named for Exmoor, Devon, in south west England. This theory is more plausible because many towns and counties in Virginia were named for places in England. Northampton County itself was named for Northamptonshire.</p>
